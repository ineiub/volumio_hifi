The "Printable mini HiFi" is a compact and aesthetically pleasing DIY audio system designed for 3D printing. 
This project was born from a desire to recycle existing electronic components, resulting in a functional and satisfying piece of technology. 
I invested a lot in the search for a clean and elegant design, modern but without becoming tacky.
At its core, the system utilizes a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B running Volumio for a clean and user-friendly interface, displayed on a 7" LCD screen. 
High-quality audio output is achieved through a HiFiBerry AMP2 amplifier driving two 4ohm full-range speakers.

The enclosure is entirely 3D printed, primarily using Sunlu PLA+ for the white elements, which offers a matte finish and soft touch after sanding. 
The black components are printed with ALFAOMNIA carbon fiber PETG, chosen for its matte finish and requiring no post-processing. 
The project was developed using an Anycubic i3 Mega printer, with specific printing recommendations provided for optimal results.
